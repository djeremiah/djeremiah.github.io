# Summit Day Four

It has been a whirlwind week. Red Hat Summit is always an excellent opportunity to meet with folks and experience technologies that you may not cross paths with on a daily basis. I've been able to fire lasers at IoT sensors, run wild through early-morning San Francisco, participate in improptu discussions with Drools and jBPM engineers, and share my work on Big Data and BxMS.

Tuesday we had the Summit opening keynote: an always-energizing talk from our CEO Jim Whitehurst. I was able to sit in on many different breakout sessions and staffed the Red Hat booth in the partner pavillion. This was one of my favorite parts of the week, as I was able to have lots of in-depth conversations in a very short period of time as customers moved through the pavillion. I was lucky enough to be able to get into the Google Codestarter on the waitlist. We walked through a Kubernetes lab on Google's cloud environment. The session was informative, and set me up well to participate in the "Code Healthy with OpenShift" [hackathon](http://openshift.devpost.com). If anyone has ideas for what to submit, hit me up.

Wednesday started with the traditional Summit 5k. I don't run as often as I would like, but I always try to participate in the fun run every year. It gets me out of bed early and San Francisco is particularly fun early in the morning. We ran down to the Embarcadero, around Giant's Stadium, and back up to the convention center. In the evening, we had a Codestarter on IoT wherein we set up a UI on our laptops to help us play a game of laser target practice with a TI SensorTag. 

Thursday (today) is the last official day of Summit. There are a few wrap-up things in the morning, but ultimately it's just "fly home" day for me. Since i'm headed east, that means that all the extra time I picked up on Monday is going to go away. I was lucky enough to sit down today with Mark Proctor, Kris Verlaenen, Mario Fusco and Duncan Doyle to discus some of the present and future direction for Drools and jBPM. I'm particularly excited about the things they're working on to help package and share extensions for the authoring and runtime environments.

Today was also the day Anurag Saran, [Sal Elrahal](http://salemelrahal.org) and I gave our session on integrating big data and business rules/proccesses. I'll save a deeper writeup of the session for a later date, but it was a great experience and I hope to be back at Summit next year to present again.
