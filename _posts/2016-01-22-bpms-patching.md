Keeping your BPMS environment fully patched and updated is a critical component of getting the most out of your Red Hat subscription. Each update contains not only fixes for the bugs you may have encountered, but also fixes for the bugs that other customers have encountered, as well as feature enhancements, performance tuning, and security patches. In this way, each customer receives the full benefit of the community.

Some resources to review when keeping your environment up to date:
