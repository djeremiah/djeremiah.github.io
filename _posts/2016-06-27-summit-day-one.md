# Welcome to Red Hat Summit
Day one at Summit is always a doozy. This year, Summit is being held in San Francisco. For me, this means a cross-country flight, a ride on the BART, and a quick trip to the Hotel to drop off my things before the day even really "starts".

This year I'm attending both DevNation and Summit. Unfortunately, I missed the DevNation opening keynote. Fortunately, it was [recorded](https://youtu.be/nxnIpgHQ-Gw) so I can sit down and watch it later. One thing I'm looking forward to is the announcement of .NET on RHEL. More on that below.

Lunch included a series of lightning talks. Including a particularly entertaining bit from Diogenes. The cake is not a lie. [https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/drettori/cake-ops-black](https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/drettori/cake-ops-black)

In the afternoon, I heard more on Eclipse Che from the Codenvy team, how to manage versioning big binaries with Git LFS and a great primer on .NET on RHEL from Rick Wagner. It's a bold new world we're moving towards, with .NET on RHEL and Bash in Windows. 

The evening ended with a Codestarter from the Google Kubernetes team. Kudos to the team for putting together an excellent quickstart that got us spinning up replicas on the GCloud environment in minutes.

Tomorrow, the Summit opening keynote and breakout sessions.
