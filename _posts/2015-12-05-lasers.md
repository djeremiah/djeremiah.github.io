Yesterday, I went in for laser refractive surgery. It was, without a doubt, the best thing I have ever done for myself. I highly recommend all the fine folks at [Beach Eye Care](http://www.beacheyecare.com/) and Dr. Neatrour in particular, who took great care of me.

If you're a good candidate for laser surgery, I would encourage you to look into it. I wake up in the morning, open my eyes and there's the world.
